# AnalogTimer

An analog timer, with an industrial look, that uses a milliammeter to display the time left.

## Modes

### Tooth brush timer mode

This mode is indicated by the green LED. In this mode the maximum time is 60s (see green scale) and the timer resets and restarts once it time runs up. 

This is ideal for short, repetitive tasks, that need to be timed such as brushing teeth dedicating a certain time to each quadrant.

### Egg timer mode

This mode is indicated by the yellow LED. In this mode the maximum time is 20min (see yellow scale) and the timer resets but doesn't restart once it time runs up. 

This is ideal for one time tasks that need timing, as any egg timer.

### Cook alert mode

This mode is indicated by the red LED. In this mode the maximum time is 20min (see red scale) and the timer resets and restarts once it time runs up. 

This is ideal for one time tasks that require periodic attention. I use it when I leave stuff to cook and go on with my work so that I don't forget about what's on the hobs.


## Sounds

Sounds are turned off by default. If you want sounds you will need to power up the unit while keeping pressed the button on the rotary encoder. A beep will confirm the sounds 
are on.

The timer will sound when the time is up. In egg timer mode it will beep a sequence similar to time signals on radio (3 beeps, pause, 1 long beep). In the other modes it
will beep 4 times and then restart the countdown.

## Other features

The timer has a per-mode time memory. So if you start the timer in tooth brush mode at, say, 20s the next time you power it up it will remember this setting. There is one 
memory for each mode, so changing modes you won't lose the setting.

To change mode you need to long press on the rotary encoder button. The lit LED will change and indicate what mode you are in.
